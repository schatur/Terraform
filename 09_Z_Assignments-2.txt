Create a new Terraform file called main.tf.
Create three variables.
The first variable, called image_name, needs to be set to ghost:latest.
The second variable is called container_name with a default of ghost_blog.
The final variable is called ext_port and set the default to port 80.

Create a Docker image resource called ghost_image that uses the image_name variable.

Create a Docker container resource called ghost_container.
The name will use the container_name variable.
The image will use the ghost_image resource.
The internal port will be set to 2368.
The external port will use ext_port variable.

Initialize Terraform.

Create a Terraform plan that uses the following variables:

container_name = ghost_blog1
image_name = ghost:alpine
ext_port = 8080
Output the plan to a file called tfplan.

Then apply the plan using tfplan and make sure that the apply doesn’t prompt for input.



vi main.tf



variable "image_name" {
  default = "ghost:latest"
}

variable "container_name" {
  default = "ghost_blog"
}

variable "ext_port" {
  default = 8001
}

  name = "${var.image_name}"
